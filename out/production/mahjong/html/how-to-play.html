<h1>How To Play</h1>
<h2>Removing Tiles</h2>
<p>Remove tiles by matching them with each other. When hovering over a tile that can be removed, the cursor will change to a clicker. Selecting a tile will highlight it so you can remember what you're trying to match with. Selecting a matching tile will remove them from the board and selecting a non-matching tile will move the highlighting to that tile. As you remove tiles, they will appear on the right side. Outside of tournament mode you can undo or redo moves, placing tiles back on the board from the discard or removing the tiles again. See the game rules for more information on what allows you to remove tiles.</p>

<h2>New Game Options</h2>
<ul>
    <li>New Game - Starts a brand new game.</li>
    <li>Restart Game - Places all the tiles from the current game back on the board.</li>
    <li>New Numbered Game - Start a new game based on a seed. This allows you to play the same board by putting down the same number. The seed number for the game is displayed in the title of the window.</li>
    <li>New Tournament Game - Starts a new game without undo/redo and without the ability to see the tiles that have been removed. Does now allow entering a number seed.</li>
</ul>
