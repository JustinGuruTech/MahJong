<h1>MahJong Game Rules</h1>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>The objective of the game is to remove all of the tiles from the board displaying the image below. This requires matching and removing tiles from the board to open up other tiles for removal.</p>

<h2>Removing Tiles</h2>
<p>A tile can be removed given two conditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Either the left or the right side must not have a tile immediately next to it.</li>
    <li>There must not be a tile on top of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Selecting a tile eligible for removal will highlight that tile. Selecting another eligible tile that matches it will remove both of them from the board and adding them to the discard area.</p>

<h2>Undo/Redo</h2>
<p>When playing outside of Tournament Mode, players can Undo as far back as the start of the game. After undoing moves, players can Redo up to their most recent move, but once they make a play they can no longer Redo.</p>

<h2>Tournament Mode</h2>
<p>Tournament mode removes the ability to undo/redo and removes the discard pane showing removed tiles. </p>
